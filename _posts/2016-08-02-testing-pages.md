I have developed a graduate class "CENG 621: Machine Learning" and I am offering it in Spring 2020 at Cankaya University.

## CENG 621 Machine Learning
-----

The course is a graduate level course, which covers different techniques of machine learning methods in a comparative way. The course includes both theoretical and practical sides of machine learning through a comprehensive set of experiments.  The practical side of the course will be in parallel with the theoretical discussions conducted in the lecture hours. The main expected outcome of the course is providing the students with the capability of analyzing real life machine learning problems, selecting appropriate solution for them, and improving the performance of the general machine learning solution by adapting them according to the requirements of each specific problem.
